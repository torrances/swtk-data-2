currently not well choreographed, but functional

"data-imdb-scrape"
- multiple HTML files per movie are downloaded
- text is extracted on a 1..1 file basis into DAT files
- data is combined into a single JSON and written to disk

"data-imdb-parse"
- imports the single JSON and post-processes it and writes minified version to disk

"data-imdb-mda"
- not being used ... too hard to get complex data like this in binary format

"data-imdb-mongo-populate"
- not a maven project; won't show up here
- contains python scripts

	$ python populate.py 100 <path> imdb col1 -v
		$python populate.py 100 /Users/craigtrim/data/Data/imdb/json-2/ imdb col1 -v
